This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Project Overview

This project is a **Front-End Web Development Assessment** for my course at **UCD Professional Academy**. As part of this project, I will also be **redesigning a friend's local business website** [www.limitless-marketing.ie](https://www.limitless-marketing.ie) while integrating a **REST API** to meet the project brief.

**Limitless Marketing** is a **sales agency and marketing company** that specialises in:
1. **Door-to-door sales**
2. **Promoting different businesses and charities**

This is a **live website**, available at: [https://www.limitless-marketing.ie](https://www.limitless-marketing.ie)  
It is currently being **hosted on Vercel**.
